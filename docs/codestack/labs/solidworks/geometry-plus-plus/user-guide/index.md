Available commands can be found in the appropriate toolbar. Each command will display the property page for editing and insertion. Feature will be inserted into the feature tree as the result of the operation.

All features support parametric functionality and will be automatically updated once model or dependency features or selections have been changed.

Feature can be edited, suppressed, reordered and deleted just as any other standard feature in SOLIDWORKS.

Some of the features expose dimensions which can be modified, linked to design table or controlled via APIs.
