SwEx.AddIn framework provides functionality for handling the data (both serializing and deserializing) in SOLIDWORKS 3rd party [storage (stream)](stream) and [storage store](storage).

Refer [Data saving in the 3rd party storage using SOLIDWORKS API](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/data-storage/third-party/) for detailed overview of 3rd party storage and store.

It is recommended to use this functionality in conjunction with [Documents Management](/docs/codestack/labs/solidworks/swex/add-in/documents-management/) by overriding the [OnLoadFromStream](https://docs.codestack.net/swex/add-in/html/M_CodeStack_SwEx_AddIn_Core_DocumentHandler_OnLoadFromStream.htm), [OnSaveToStream](https://docs.codestack.net/swex/add-in/html/M_CodeStack_SwEx_AddIn_Core_DocumentHandler_OnSaveToStream.htm), [OnLoadFromStorageStore](https://docs.codestack.net/swex/add-in/html/M_CodeStack_SwEx_AddIn_Core_DocumentHandler_OnLoadFromStorageStore.htm), [OnSaveToStorageStore](https://docs.codestack.net/swex/add-in/html/M_CodeStack_SwEx_AddIn_Core_DocumentHandler_OnSaveToStorageStore.htm) methods.
