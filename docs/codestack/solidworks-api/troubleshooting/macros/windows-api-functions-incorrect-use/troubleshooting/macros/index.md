SOLIDWORKS macro is the most common way to automate and extended the functionality of SOLIDWORKS via its API.
Macros can be developed in-house or downloaded from the different web-sites including SOLIDWORKS forum, 3D Content Central, [CodeStack](/docs/codestack/solidworks-tools) etc. or even recorded from SOLIDWORKS.

But in some cases the macro doesn't work as expected. This is usually one of the following scenarios:

* Macro which used to work correctly before stopped working.
* Macro works on some of the workstations but not on the others.
* Macro works correctly for some models but not the others.

In this article I will go through the most common symptoms of the errors in the macros.
