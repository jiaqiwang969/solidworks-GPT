Domain names are used in urls to identify the location of the web-page. Domain represents IP addresses. When you browse the internet you will enter the domain name which will redirect you to the corresponding web-site (e.g. https://www.codestack.net).

Domain names have extensions, such as .com, .net, .org. Domain extensions can be available for general use (such as .com and .net e-mails) or be restricted to specific industry or entity (.org for organization, .gov for governments) or country (.us for USA, .com.au for Australia, .ca for Canada).

This section contains guides and tutorials for hosting and maintaining custom domains on cloud services (e.g. GoDaddy, Google domain, Hostgator, etc.) and on premises.
