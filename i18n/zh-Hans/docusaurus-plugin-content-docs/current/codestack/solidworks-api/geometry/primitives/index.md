Explore the methods of the [IModeler](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModeler.html) SOLIDWORKS API interface to learn how to create geometric objects.

Use the [IPartDoc::CreateFeatureFromBody3](https://help.solidworks.com/2016/english/api/sldworksapi/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IPartDoc~CreateFeatureFromBody3.html) SOLIDWORKS API method to create a permanent body from a temporary body.
