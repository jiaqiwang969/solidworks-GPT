The diagram below shows the relationships between interfaces in the SOLIDWORKS API object model. This is not a complete class hierarchy, but rather a representation of commonly used methods and interfaces.

The chart is interactive and can be zoomed and panned using the mouse wheel. The navigation controls in the bottom right corner allow for zooming and fitting the window size.

All the boxes and arrows are clickable, and clicking on them will take you to information pages about specific methods, properties, or interfaces.
