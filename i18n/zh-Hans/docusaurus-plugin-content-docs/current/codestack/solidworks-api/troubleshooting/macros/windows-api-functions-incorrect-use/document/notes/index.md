[INote](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.INote.html) interface is a SOLIDWORKS API representation of the note annotation. This interface would work with notes in assembly, part and drawing environments.

Pointer to the note can be retrieved via [IAnnotation::GetSpecificAnnotation](https://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks~solidworks.interop.sldworks.iannotation~getspecificannotation.html) SOLIDWORKS API call.

This section contains various macro examples and code snippets for managing notes in SOLIDWORKS using API.
