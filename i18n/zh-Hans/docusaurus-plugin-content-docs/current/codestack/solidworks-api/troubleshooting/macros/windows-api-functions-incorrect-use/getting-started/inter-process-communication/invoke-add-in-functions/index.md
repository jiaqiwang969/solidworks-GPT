labels: [add-in api,invoke]

This section contains examples and explains how to create an API for SOLIDWORKS add-in so its functions can be called from [Macros](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/getting-started/macros/), [Stand-Alone Applications](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/getting-started/stand-alone/), [Scripts](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/getting-started/scripts/) or other [Add-Ins](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/getting-started/add-ins/)

Enabling API functions in your add-in might be required when add-in itself needs to be automated. This approach can also help to improve performance. As add-ins are in-process applications, they provide the best performance. In this case add-in can act as an engine for the functionality which gets triggered from the macro or another add-in so the performance is optimal.

There are several approaches could be used to achieve this functionality. Explore the following options for more information:

* [Via Add-In Object](via-add-in-object)
* [Via Running Objects Table (ROT)](via-rot)
* [Via In-Process Invoking From Out-Of-Process Applications](in-process-invoking)
