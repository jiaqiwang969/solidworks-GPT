 Methods for performing interprocess communication between SOLIDWORKS applications (macros, add-ins, standalone applications)
labels: [communication, parameters]

This section describes methods for performing interprocess communication between applications developed for SOLIDWORKS. Communication involves passing custom parameters or signals between different modules, namely macros, add-ins, and standalone applications.

This can introduce an additional level of automation for applications developed for SOLIDWORKS. For example, interprocess communication can be achieved using technologies such as COM, named pipes, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), shared memory, buffers, file exchange, etc.

Please refer to this section for detailed guides and examples on establishing communication between SOLIDWORKS software development.
