![SOLIDWORKS API for adorning models and applications](adornment-api.png)

This section contains a series of articles and code examples explaining different methods to customize SOLIDWORKS model and application framework views using the API.

This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Adding [callout](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/adornment/callouts/) objects. These objects can be used to display additional information, such as labels or properties for specific entities. Callouts also support data value input.
* Injecting custom 3D graphics into model views using OpenGL. This is useful when you need to render complex graphics directly within a SOLIDWORKS model without modifying its geometry. The most common use cases are for preview or finite element analysis (FEA) rendering.
* Adding 2D images to graphic views.
* Embedding [OLE objects](/docs/codestack/solidworks-api/adornment/ole-objects/) within models.
