Default installation of SOLIDWORKS PDM includes couple of useful tasks:

* Convert - allowing automatically export SOLIDWORKS files to a foreign format
* Print - allowing to print SOLIDWORKS drawing in the configured printers

Both of these tasks expose their source code. This means that additional SOLIDWORKS PDM API could be used to customize the tasks logic.

This section contains several examples and guidelines on configuring and changing the functionality of the built-in tasks using SOLIDWORKS PDM API.
